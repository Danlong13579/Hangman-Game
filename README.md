# Hangman Game
This is a small javascript project I made to show my abilities with javascript and DOM manipulation.  

### Concepts I Used
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Dom Selection and Query
- Builling html through javascript loops
- Javascript Loop for easy replayability
- Code refactoring 
- UX supplying the player with feedback 
- Clean code and comments **(readability)**
